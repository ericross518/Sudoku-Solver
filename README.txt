Overview:

A Sudoku puzzle is a number placement puzzle.  For our purposes the board is a 9x9 grid.  Each cell can contain a number from 1 – 9.  

The rules for the board are:

Each row can only contain one instance of each number 1 – 9

Each column can only contain one instance of each number 1 – 9

Each 3x3 quadrant can only contain one instance of each number 1 – 9

 

 

The objective is simple, write a program that solves Sudoku puzzles.  Please implement your solution in Java, C# or JavaScript depending on language of choice and / or position relevance.  You will have to read in the starting board from a text file.  There are four starting boards attached here.  An X represents an open cell and a number indicates a starting value for a cell.  You can print out the solution to either a text file or to the console.  Please implement your own solution as opposed to using an existing library.  

Please zip up your project and include the following items:  source code for your project and the solutions to the four puzzles.
